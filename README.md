# L-SYSTEM GRAPHIC

An L-system that creates a **fractal graphic** after a certain number of iterations. This was made using JFLAP for the Automata and Language Theory course in the university.

Here is the file directory:

   ```
    fractalg-bonus
    ├── wave.jff
    ├── description.pdf
    ├── img.png
    └── README.md
   ```
<br />

## Running Project
1. Open the JFLAP application to use the *.jff* file.

2. Iterate until Iteration 17 to see the best output graphic.
